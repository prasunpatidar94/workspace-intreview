    serialVersionUID

    Custom serialization using writeObject/readObject

    Deep copy using serialization

    Backward compatibility in serialized classes

    JSON/XML serialization with Jackson/Gson

10. Reflection & Annotations

    Reflection API: Class, Method, Field, Constructor

    Runtime annotations and their processing

    Custom annotations and annotation processors

    Meta-annotations: @Retention, @Target, @Inherited

    Use of reflection in frameworks (e.g., Spring, Hibernate)

11. Generics & Type System

    Generic classes, interfaces, methods

    Wildcards: <? extends T>, <? super T>

    Type erasure and its limitations

    Bounded and unbounded generics

    Generic method overloading and ambiguity

12. Functional Programming

    Built-in functional interfaces: Predicate, Function, Consumer, Supplier

    Method references

    Stream operations: Intermediate vs Terminal

    Collectors and grouping

    Optional class: map, flatMap, orElse, isPresent
